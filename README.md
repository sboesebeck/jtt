# Java Typing Tutor
this little project was the attempt to create a typing tutor, where you can practice touch typing with more alternative layouts.
in later version it should be possible to add you own layout quite easily.

## description
the lesson starts as soon as you type the first letter. Measurements start also then. for all lessons you type, the system records statistics. 
while typing you see, the speed and accuracy, in total and for each line... if you do the lesson several times in a row, you can see your last accuracy for each line.
you also see the layout on screen, if you need to see which finger you need to use for which letter. This updates, if you change the layout.

below that, there is the accuracy for every finger and every character. there you can identify things, you maybe need to train more.

last but not least you can choose your lesson to be dynamic. that will then choose the line with the lowest accuracy for you to try next.
